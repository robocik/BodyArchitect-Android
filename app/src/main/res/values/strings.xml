	<string name="feature_premium_equipments_description">You are in the gym and you want to do Bench Press, but the bench is occupied by someone else. So you decide to do this exercise on a machine. The problem with machines is that often you can put more weights than on barbell. In this case if you write this in your log (Bench Press with more weight), then you will see in your reports that you have a nice progress (increased weight for this exercise). But this is not true, because you did this in different way, by using different equipment.
